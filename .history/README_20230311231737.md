To start this project in a live environment, you will need to follow these steps:

    Install Node.js on your machine if it's not already installed. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/

    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

    Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file:

npm install

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

npm run dev

This will start the development server and open your web browser to http://localhost:3000/, where you can see your project running.

To build the project for production, run the following command:

npm run build

This will create a dist folder with the compiled and optimized project files that you can deploy to a web server.

You can also use the preview script to preview the production build locally before deploying:

    npm run preview

    This will serve the production build locally at http://localhost:5000/.

That's it! You can now start working on your project and see the changes live by refreshing your browser.
